### 1. **Introduction**

#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for a **To-Do List and Task Management System**. This system allows users to create, update, delete, and organize their to-do items and priorities. Users can set due dates, mark tasks as completed, and track their progress. Additional features include notifications, local storage support, and import/export of task data.

#### 1.2 Scope
This system is designed for users who need an efficient way to manage tasks, prioritize them, and track deadlines. It is intended for individual use, but the system could be adapted for collaboration in future iterations. The system will operate within a web browser, leveraging HTML5, JavaScript, and local storage for data persistence.

- **Priority List**: A separate list for high-priority tasks.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Options to sort tasks by due date and filter tasks by keywords.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved locally to the user's browser.
- **Import/Export**: Users can import/export their task data in JSON format.
- **Notifications**: Alerts notify users of actions like task addition, completion, or reminder prompts.

- **UI Elements Involved**: `input#new-todo`, `button#add-todo`, `input#new-priority`, `button#add-priority`

#### 3.2 Edit Task Functionality
- **Description**: The user should be able to edit an existing task.
- **Input**: Updated task description and/or due date.
- **Output**: The task will update in place, reflecting changes to the description or due date.
- **UI Elements Involved**: `button.edit-btn`, input field for the task and date.

#### 3.3 Delete Task Functionality
- **Description**: The user should be able to delete a task from the list.
- **Input**: Click on the delete button.
- **Output**: The task will be removed from the list, and the user will receive a notification.
- **UI Elements Involved**: `button.remove-btn`

#### 3.4 Mark Task as Completed
- **Description**: Users should be able to mark a task as completed by checking the checkbox next to the task.
- **Input**: Checkbox toggle.
- **Output**: Completed tasks will have a line-through effect, and progress charts will update.
- **UI Elements Involved**: `input[type='checkbox']`

#### 3.5 Sorting by Date
- **Description**: The system will allow sorting tasks by due date, either ascending or descending, based on user preference.
- **Input**: Checkbox toggle for sorting.
- **Output**: Tasks are reordered by due date in the list.
- **UI Elements Involved**: `input#sort-recent`

#### 3.6 Filtering Tasks
- **Description**: The user should be able to filter the tasks by typing a keyword in the search box.
- **Input**: Search query.
- **Output**: The list will display only tasks that match the search query.
- **UI Elements Involved**: `input#todo-search`, `input#priority-search`

#### 3.7 Notifications
- **Description**: Users will receive notifications for certain actions (e.g., task addition, completion, deletion).
- **Output**: A notification message will briefly display on the screen.
- **UI Elements Involved**: `div#notification-container`

#### 3.8 Save to Local Storage
- **Description**: The system should automatically save the user's tasks and priorities to local storage.
- **Trigger**: Task addition, deletion, or edit.
- **Output**: Data is stored in the browser's local storage.
- **UI Elements Involved**: `localStorage.setItem`

#### 3.9 Import/Export Data
- **Description**: The system allows users to export their tasks and priorities to a JSON file and import previously saved data.
- **Input**: File upload for import, download for export.
- **Output**: Data is loaded from or saved to the JSON file.
- **UI Elements Involved**: File input and download link

### 4. **Non-Functional Requirements**

#### 4.1 Performance Requirements
- The system must load and save tasks instantly.
- Sorting and filtering should be performed in less than 1 second.

#### 4.2 Usability Requirements
- The system should have a clean and simple UI, allowing users to add, edit, and delete tasks with minimal clicks.
- All notifications should be short and disappear after a few seconds.

#### 4.3 Compatibility Requirements
- The system must work on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- The system should function without an internet connection as it relies on local storage.

#### 4.4 Data Integrity
- The data saved in local storage should persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
- Imported data should overwrite the current task list without errors or data corruption.

### 5. **User Interface**

- **To-Do List Area**: Contains input fields for task entry, due date, and a list of current tasks.
- **Priority List Area**: Contains input fields for priority task entry and a list of priority tasks.
- **Control Elements**: Sort toggle, filter input boxes, and action buttons (edit, delete).
- **Notification Area**: Displays notifications at the top of the screen.
- **Import/Export**: File input for import and a button to download the task data as a JSON file.

### 6. **Assumptions and Constraints**
- The user is expected to have a modern browser with local storage enabled.
- Data is stored only locally, and users are responsible for backing up their own data.
- The system does not include any server-side components.
